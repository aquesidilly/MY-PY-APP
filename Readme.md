When clicked, the menu will expand out from the right side of the screen displaying all nav items.

The following navigation items will be implemented:

Home - index.html
* Register - register.html
* Sign In - login.html
* Base - base.html

In order to create or modify , a user will have to register and login to the app. Only the creator of the app will have the ability to edit or delete movies, this is to prevent unwanted modification or deletion of movies by other users. A flash message will be shown to the user to alert them whether the edit or delete their movies was successful or failed.

A Sign In page will be implemented to allow registered users the ability to login in to their account.

Once a user has successfully logged in, they will be redirected to their home page. The users basic details will be displayed on their home page, along with any movies they have created. The user will be able to edit or delete their movies from the home page. This page will only be available to logged in users, this includes the visibility of the navigation menu item.

* Security
Database connection details are set up in an env.py for development, for security reasons this is not uploaded to GitHub so that database and connection details are not visible to users. In production these are stored in Heroku.

#The Surface Plane
#Design
*Colour Scheme
The main background colour is a cream #d2d2af for the header, footer and form button backgrounds.

The main website text is black #000000

All custom heading text is a deep shade of red #831717

*Typography
The main heading on all pages and in the expanded materialize collapsible element headings use the 'PT Serif' font while the rest of the websites content uses the 'Play' font.

# Testing
 # Test Strategy
  # Summary
Testing is required on all features and user stories documented in this README. All clickable links must redirect to the correct pages. All forms linked to MongoDB must be tested to ensure they insert all given fields into the correct collections.

HTML Code must pass through the W3C HTML Validator.

CSS Code must pass through the W3C CSS Validator.

JavaScript code must pass through the JSHint Validator.

Python Code must pass through PEP8 Validator

* Access Requirements
Tester must have access to MongoDB in order to manually verify the insertion of records to users and events collections.

* Regression Testing
All features previous tested during development in a local environment must be regression tested in production on the live website.

* Assumptions and Dependencies
Testing is dependent on the website being deployed live on Heroku.

* Out of Scope
Only test cases listed under High Level Test Cases will be performed as part of this testing effort.

# Test Results

# Deployment
 # Project Creation
To create this project I used the CI Gitpod Full Template by navigating here and clicking the 'Use this template' button.

I was then directed to the create new repository from template page and entered in my desired repo name, then clicked Create repository from template button.

Once created, I navigated to my new repository on GitHub and clicked the Gitpod button which built my workspace.

The following commands were used for version control throughout the project:

 * git add filename - This command was used to add files to the staging area before committing.

 * git commit -m "commit message explaining the updates" - This command was used to to commit changes to the local repository.

 * git push - This command is used to push all committed changes to the GitHub repository.

#Deployment to Heroku
 # Create application:

 1. Navigate to Heroku.com and login.
 2. Click on the new button.
 3. Select create new app.
 4. Enter the app name.
 5. Select region.
 # Set up connection to Github Repository:

 1. Click the deploy tab and select GitHub - Connect to GitHub.
 2. A prompt to find a github repository to connect to will then be displayed.
 3. Enter the repository name for the project and click search.
 4. Once the repo has been found, click the connect button.
 # Set environment variables:

Click the settings tab and then click the Reveal Config Vars button and add the following:

 1. key: IP, value: 0.0.0.0
 2. key: PORT, value: 5000
 3. key: MONGO_DBNAME, value: (database name you want to connect to)
 4. key: MONGO_URI, value: (mongo uri - This can be found in MongoDB by going to clusters > connect > connect to your application and substituting the password and dbname that you set up in the link).
 5. key: SECRET_KEY, value: (This is a custom secret key set up for configuration to keep client-side sessions secure).
 # Enable automatic deployment:

 1. Click the Deploy tab
 2. In the Automatic deploys section, choose the branch you want to deploy from then click Enable Automation Deploys.
# Run Locally
# Note: The project will not run locally with database connections unless the user sets up an env.py file configuring IP, PORT, MONGO_URI, MONGO_DBNAME and SECRET_KEY. You must have the connection details in order to do this. These details are private and not disclosed in this repository for security purposes.

 1. Navigate to the GitHub Repository.
 2. Click the Code drop down menu.
 3. Either Download the ZIP file, unpackage locally and open with IDE (This route ends here) OR Copy Git URL from the HTTPS dialogue box.
 4. Open your developement editor of choice and open a terminal window in a directory of your choice.
 5. Use the 'git clone' command in terminal followed by the copied git URL.
 6. A clone of the project will be created locally on your machine.
Once the project has been loaded into an IDE of choice, run the following command in the shell to install all the required packages:

pip install -r requirements.txt

# Fork Project
Most commonly, forks are used to either propose changes to someone else's project or to use someone else's project as a starting point for your own idea. - Definition from Github Docs.

 1. Navigate to the GitHub Repository you want to fork.

 2. On the top right of the page under the header, click the fork button.
